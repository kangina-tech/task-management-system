# Task Management System 📃
Because I use task management apps like Google Calendar and Notion (my note book if we are being very serious about minute planning), it made sense to make my first dart project focus on creating one. The application does not have life out of the console but this shall be changed at a later time when I have grown more accustomed to Dart.

## Technology 🧑‍💻

## Features 🪶
What can you do with the task management system?
* Add Tasks
* Remove Tasks
* Update Tasks
* Display Tasks
* Save Tasks

## The Process 💭
The first step had been creating the Task Class. This had been the easiest part as the class had a few lines of code to enter. This was where the major parts of the TMS got established. 

The second step was creating the task class list. Here, I was focusing on creating the characteristics listed in the feature. 

The third step had been creating the inheritance cycle - focusing on heirarchial inheritance of the specialized tasks that were both homework and work. It had been a very tricky step as up until now, I had only rudementary understanding of inheritance and had only practiced it on very simple algorithms. 

The forth step was creating user interactivity. The TMS would be nothing without users interacting with it. This part was completely out of scope for the class but I found it interesting when I finally got around to understanding parts of it. It follows the same sort of syntax as C so it was not completely new though it was a bit stressful.

The fifth and last step was creating data persistance aka, implementing the save and store functionality to TMS. Just like the last two parts, it was new but not completely unlike the functionaliity of both C and Python. 

## What Did I Learn? 🧑‍🎓
**Inheritance** - There are so many things that can go wrong with inheritance but when gotten right, it is the most satisfying process.
**Interactivity** - Being used to interactivity being a guarantee with languages like C and Python, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Dart is not inherently interactive and that it is up to the programmer to make it so. 
**New ways to create algorithms** - I still find it a challenge creating algorithms but when I get something right, it feels like a great accomplishment. I know that I can make some parts feel less clunky but that is a job for the future me!
**Time Management** - I set a specific time frame and I blew right past it. That being said, I learnt more on how to create realistic time frames as opposed to what I am feeling.
**New knowledge** - The <kbd> <br> import 'dart.io' <br> </kbd> function. It is a whole new topic that I am to cover in depth. 

## Improvements ➕
* Creating a UI
* Adding a bit of customization to it

## How To Run It 🏃‍♂️
* Fork repository to your own Github account.
* Clone repository to your own machine.
* Open the code on preferred editor.
* Make sure you have all the dependancies you might need for the code to work. If not, you can use <kbd> <br> npm install <br> </kbd> to install and <kbd> <br> npm run start <br> </kbd> to run.
* You should be able to access it in your terminal.
